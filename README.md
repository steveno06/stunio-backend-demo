# stunio-backend-demo

 Back end for the Stunio demo. Created with Python and FastAPI.

## My Thoughts

Again here I think its a great start but there is so much more to do with this. I would have liked to implement some authenticaiton with tokens, such as JWT, to protect this back end resource. And also put more thought into the way data should be stored with the use cases of the app. How do we match students to jobs? And how should we be storing the data to effeciently be used by the matching algorithim.
